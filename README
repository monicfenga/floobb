FlooBB is an easy to use bulletin board system which does not rely on an
external database. It simply uses text files to store the data and is optimized
for speed. It incorporates TinyMCE to provide a WYSIWYG method of entering
posts into the system.

Usage:

Simply extract the contents of the release to a directory on your server and
browse to this directory using your web browser. The install.php script will
run. You will have to input some details about the administrator account. Once
you are done, delete or rename install.php and then once again, go to the
directory with your web browser. You should see the main page of the forum.The
html of the board may be customized by changing OutHtml.php.
